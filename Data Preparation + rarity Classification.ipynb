MICE might introduce bias because it would generate values based on the distribution of known values. This means that if one category was particularly dominant in the existing data, MICE would most likely fill missing values with this dominant category. The ordinal encoder could also introduce bias because it imposes an order on the categories, meaning that the model may interpret the categories as having an ordered relationship that doesn't actually exist. Keeping 'Unknown' as a category for missing values has its own potential bias. It assumes that the missing data is completely at random and does not depend on any other feature in the dataset. However, this might not always be true. It's also possible that we're losing potentially valuable information that could have been inferred from other columns. Additionally, some machine learning models may interpret 'Unknown' as a distinct category, which could influence the model in unintended ways.\n","Considering the current dataset and the Pokémon universe's complexity, it was decided that the 'Unknown' category was the least biased way to handle missing values."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":30,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"collapsed":true,"executionInfo":{"elapsed":223,"status":"ok","timestamp":1686177135753,"user":{"displayName":"Dennis Donkoh","userId":"12383720488021935070"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"6bu5H8ZA_SiH","outputId":"4a31b105-6888-4218-dd15-b00732085db0"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/sklearn/preprocessing/_encoders.py:868: FutureWarning: `sparse` was renamed to `sparse_output` in version 1.2 and will be removed in 1.4. `sparse_output` is ignored unless you leave `sparse` to its default value.\n","  warnings.warn(\n"]}],"source":["# Separate target variable\n","y = pokemon_data['status']\n","pokemon_data.drop('status', axis=1, inplace=True)\n","# print(pokemon_data.columns)\n","\n","# Split data into training set and test set\n","X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(pokemon_data, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n","\n","# List of categorical columns\n","cat_cols = X_train.select_dtypes(include=[object]).columns.tolist()\n","\n","# One-hot encoding for categorical columns\n","encoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False, handle_unknown='ignore')\n","encoder.fit(X_train[cat_cols])\n","\n","# Transform both training and testing data\n","encoded_cols_train = encoder.transform(X_train[cat_cols])\n","encoded_cols_test = encoder.transform(X_test[cat_cols])\n","\n","# Create dataframes from the encoded columns\n","encoded_df_train = pd.DataFrame(encoded_cols_train, columns = encoder.get_feature_names_out(cat_cols))\n","encoded_df_test = pd.DataFrame(encoded_cols_test, columns = encoder.get_feature_names_out(cat_cols))\n","\n","# Drop original categorical columns\n","X_train.drop(cat_cols, axis=1, inplace=True)\n","X_test.drop(cat_cols, axis=1, inplace=True)\n","\n","# Reset index for the encoded dataframes\n","encoded_df_train = encoded_df_train.reset_index(drop=True)\n","encoded_df_test = encoded_df_test.reset_index(drop=True)\n","\n","# print(\"Duplicate columns in X_train: \", X_train.columns[X_train.columns.duplicated()])\n","# print(\"Duplicate columns in encoded_df_train: \", encoded_df_train.columns[encoded_df_train.columns.duplicated()])\n","\n","# print(\"Shape of X_train: \", X_train.shape)\n","# print(\"Shape of encoded_df_train: \", encoded_df_train.shape)\n","# print(\"Shape of X_test: \", X_test.shape)\n","# print(\"Shape of encoded_df_test: \", encoded_df_test.shape)\n","\n","X_train = X_train.reset_index(drop=True)\n","encoded_df_train = encoded_df_train.reset_index(drop=True)\n","X_test = X_test.reset_index(drop=True)\n","encoded_df_test = encoded_df_test.reset_index(drop=True)\n","\n","\n","# Add the encoded columns\n","X_train = pd.concat([X_train, encoded_df_train], axis=1)\n","X_test = pd.concat([X_test, encoded_df_test], axis=1)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0oCCN1p8G7Uw"},"source":["In the snippet above, the target variable, 'status', is separated from the main dataset and stored as 'y'.

One-hot encoding is then employed to transform these categorical columns, a crucial process that facilitates more efficient interpretation of categorical data by machine learning algorithms. Unique names are generated for these newly encoded columns, and the transformed data is stored in a new DataFrame, 'encoded_df'. Following this transformation, the original categorical columns are removed from the dataset, and the indices for both the original and encoded DataFrames are reset to ensure consistency. The original DataFrame (with the dropped categorical columns) and the 'encoded_df' are then combined into a single DataFrame.

It shows that all the classes now have the same number of samples (734 in this case), meaning that the class imbalance has been successfully addressed.\n","\n","SMOTE achieves this by creating \"synthetic\" examples of the minority class. It operates by finding instances of the minority class that are close together in the feature space, drawing lines between these instances, and then creating new instances along these lines. The goal is to increase the number of minority class instances in a way that is plausible given the available data.\n","\n","It's important to note that SMOTE only balances the classes in the training set. The original distribution of classes in the test set is preserved. This is because the test set should reflect the real-world distribution of classes as closely as possible to give an accurate estimate of model performance."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":37,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"collapsed":true,"executionInfo":{"elapsed":34,"status":"ok","timestamp":1686177213611,"user":{"displayName":"Dennis Donkoh","userId":"12383720488021935070"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"Ta5Ay7hnDPYk","outputId":"23110f0e-cf6f-411e-e158-f14a7da1d827"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Precision:  0.9656084656084656\n","Recall:  0.8193181818181818\n","F1 Score:  0.8819871394303453\n","ROC AUC Score:  0.8840309502055733\n","               precision    recall  f1-score   support\n","\n","    Legendary       0.89      0.80      0.84        10\n","     Mythical       1.00      0.75      0.86         4\n","       Normal       0.97      1.00      0.99       184\n","Sub Legendary       1.00      0.73      0.84        11\n","\n","     accuracy                           0.97       209\n","    macro avg       0.97      0.82      0.88       209\n"," weighted avg       0.97      0.97      0.97       209\n","\n"]}],"source":["# Compute Precision, Recall, F1 Score \n","precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred, average='macro')  \n","recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred, average='macro')  \n","f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred, average='macro')  \n","\n","print(\"Precision: \", precision)\n","print(\"Recall: \", recall)\n","print(\"F1 Score: \", f1)\n","\n","# Compute Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC) from prediction scores\n","\n","# Binarize the output\n","lb = LabelBinarizer()\n","y_test_bin = lb.fit_transform(y_test)\n","y_pred_bin = lb.transform(y_pred)\n","\n","roc_auc = roc_auc_score(y_test_bin, y_pred_bin, multi_class='ovr')\n","print(\"ROC AUC Score: \", roc_auc)\n","\n","# Also generate a classification report for a detailed performance analysis for each class\n","print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zVoreKRKGqSz"},"source":["The macro-average precision of the model is approximately 0.97, which is very good - it means that on average, when the model predicts a class, it is correct about 97% of the time across all classes.\n","\n","The macro-average recall is about 0.82.
