# Pokemon-Data-Mining

## Project Overview
This project uses data mining techniques to uncover significant patterns in a Pokémon dataset obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mariotormo/complete-pokemon-dataset-updated-090420. It focuses on Pokémon's total points, abilities, catch rates, rarity, and type. Data preparation includes cleaning, feature selection, and encoding categorical variables. The project applies association rule mining, clustering, classification, and regression to understand relationships between Pokémon attributes, group Pokémon, predict types, and estimate total points. 


## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Open any of the notebooks in Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook to run the code/ view outputs.
3. The clean data used for building the models was obtained after running 'Data Understanding'. You may view the differences between the original dataset

## Dependencies
This project was implemented using a Google Colab. To run it, you will need:
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
