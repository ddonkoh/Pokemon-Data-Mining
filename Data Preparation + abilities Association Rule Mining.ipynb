For each rule, the table provides several statistics:\n","\n","1. Rule `(Rock Head) => (Sturdy)`: This rule has a support of 0.010526, meaning that the combination of Rock Head and Sturdy occurs in about 1.05% of all Pokémon. The confidence is 0.523810, indicating that out of all Pokémon that have Rock Head, 52.38% also have Sturdy. The lift is 13.35, which is greater than 1, meaning that the presence of Rock Head has a positive effect on the presence of Sturdy. This is a strong rule since the lift value is high.\n","\n","2. Rule `(Beast Boost) => (Unknown)`: The support is 0.010526 (1.05% of all Pokémon have both Beast Boost and an Unknown ability), the confidence is 1 (meaning that all Pokémon with Beast Boost also have Unknown abilities), and the lift is 1.967985 (indicating that Beast Boost has a positive effect on the presence of an Unknown ability). The high confidence and lift suggest a strong association.\n","\n","3. Rule `(Blaze) => (Unknown)`: This rule has the same support, confidence, and lift as the previous rule because the Unknown ability appears to be a common consequence.\n","\n","4. Rule `(Levitate) => (Unknown)`: This rule has a slightly lower support (0.034450), but the confidence is very high (0.878049), and the lift is 1.727987. This suggests a strong association, though Levitate appears less frequently than Blaze or Beast Boost.\n","\n","In general, the rules with 'Unknown' as the consequent have high confidence (1.0) but lower lift values. This is because the 'Unknown' category is very common in the data. The rule `(Rock Head) => (Sturdy)` is an interesting finding, because even though both these abilities are not very common, they appear together more often than would be expected by chance.\n","\n","These rules do not imply causation. For instance, having the Rock Head ability doesn't cause a Pokémon to have the Sturdy ability. Instead, these rules highlight patterns in the data: Pokémon that have one of these abilities often have the other.\n","\n","The 'conviction' column can be interpreted as the ratio of the expected frequency that X occurs without Y (that is, the frequency that the rule makes an incorrect prediction) if X and Y were independent divided by the observed frequency of incorrect predictions. In this case, 'inf' values are due to the confidence being 1, and therefore, there are no observed incorrect predictions.\n","\n","The 'leverage' column calculates the difference between the observed frequency of X and Y appearing together and the frequency that would be expected if X and Y were independent.
